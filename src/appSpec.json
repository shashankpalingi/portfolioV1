The design will leverage dynamic parallax scrolling and layered elements to tell a compelling story, making the user feel like they are actively exploring Jackie's world. The 'Playful' personality will infuse the site with joy, approachability, and a sense of delightful discovery, ensuring that even complex design concepts are presented in an accessible and memorable way.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Parallax as the Primary Narrative Driver: Implement multi-layered parallax effects across sections to create depth and guide the user through the content sequentially, emphasizing impactful moments.\n2. Organic & Rounded Forms: Utilize rounded corners extensively on containers, buttons, and interactive elements to embody the 'Playful' and approachable aesthetic.\n3. Vibrant, High-Contrast Palette: Employ the specified dark background with bright, saturated accent colors to create visual energy and ensure key elements pop.\n4. Typographic Hierarchy with Personality: Use the distinct heading font for impact and a more approachable font for body text, ensuring readability while maintaining a friendly tone.\n5. Interactive Delight: Incorporate subtle, bouncy animations on hover and scroll to enhance user engagement and reinforce the playful, joyful experience.",
